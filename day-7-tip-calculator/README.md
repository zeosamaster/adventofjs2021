# Brief

In this project, we're creating a Tip Calculator.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this might be a great way to push yourself.

## Users should be able to:

- Calculate tip based on tip percentage, bill amount, and number of people
